Microchip PIC16F84A 18-pin Enhanced FLASH/EEPROM 8-bit Microcontroller

Programming the Microchip PIC16F84A using MPLAB IDE v6.60. MPLAB IDE is a software program that runs on a PC to develop applications for Microchip microcontrollers. It is called an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, because it provides a single integrated “environment” to develop code for embedded microcontrollers. An embedded system is typically a design making use of the power of a small microcontroller, like the Microchip PICmicro® MCU or dsPIC® Digital Signal Controller (DSCs). These microcontrollers combine a microprocessor unit (like the CPU in a desktop PC) with some additional circuits called “peripherals”, plus some additional circuits on the same chip to make a small control module requiring few other external devices. This single device can then be embedded into other electronic and mechanical devices for low-cost digital control.
